# Walk and Sketch Booking Platform

This is a tour booking app for a small town in Alaska. Tourists are offered several tours to choose from where they will be taken on a hike to scenic overlooks where the guide will provide a brief art lesson. Tourists can spend time in nature on their vacation and go home with unique art that they created. This is an imaginary business inspired from the creator's time spent living in Alaska. 

The app has 2 levels of user credentials, Admin and User. 
- Admin level accounts are intended to be used by the guides. They have the ability to add, edit and delete new tours on the site. They may also book tours to attend.
- Users only have the ability to book or delete their own tickets for tours.
